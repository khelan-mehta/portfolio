We are complex beings, with trillions of cells with an idea of our \"self\" and a possible illusion of \"us\" doing actions, but isn't it possible that even we, are just a response to stimuli, our thoughts and mindset and morals and belief system got drafted from what our surrounding was, a very complex response to stimuli. Like, I am vested in writing because I have seen my parents follow shuddhadvaitvad since I was a child, it made me curious as to what drives them to perform prayers everyday for 3 hours since 25+ years. This curiosity led me to Bhagwat Gita, which further led me to reading more philosophy, even though I have read very very little of what a philosophy student would have read, these words throb inside my mind and hence I feel like putting them here. Point being this current deed of writing was influenced by a lot of surrounding parameters and not original. If that is the case, we are a species burdened by an illusion of free will, if one says, one has 6 choices and one has to pick one of them, in that case that person's choice would be a resultant of years of past experiences which had an individual input to the thought process and somehow created this result, if somehow the person says i'll throw a dice to pick one, then the result is driven by physics and his mechanical input to the throw of dice, the mechanical input was again trained by past experiences. So like a domino effect, actions caused reactions which drove future actions. I would act morally because I was born in a home which gave morals an importance, someone born in midst of a war would turn out to be violent. BUT, somehow we have something known as consciousness, this innate idea of I, this self which is a witness to everything and somehow thinks it is responsible and capable to change the course of things, this self is attached to the brain, the body, the senses and the sense drives. But if we can somehow cut off the course of actions, make the I limited to witness only, can we go beyond the pains and pleasures of this body into a state of emotionless witness to the world?\nPhilosophical Analysis: Immanuel Kant & Jean-Paul Sartre\nIndividual Philosophical Critiques\nImmanuel Kant\nKant, with his deontological ethics, would emphasize that we are not merely reactive to stimuli, but possess the ability to act according to moral laws that we give ourselves. The journal entry's description of actions as responses to stimuli is reminiscent of Kant's concept of 'heteronomous' actions, guided by external influences. But Kant would argue that true freedom lies in 'autonomous' actions, guided by reason and moral law. The possibility of moral action testifies to our free will.\nJean-Paul Sartre\nSartre, from his existentialist perspective, might see the journal entry as an example of 'bad faith'. He would argue that we have radical freedom to transcend our facticity (the facts of our existence), and that our actions, thoughts, and beliefs are not mere products of our past experiences or surroundings. Even when we feel determined by our circumstances, according to Sartre, we are always free to redefine ourselves.\nPhilosophical Dialogue\nThe philosophers discuss and build upon each other's perspectives\n\nImmanuel Kant\nSartre, your concept of radical freedom is intriguing, but it seems to ignore the constraints of human nature and the world around us. Free will isn't about absolute freedom, but acting according to moral laws we give ourselves.\nJean-Paul Sartre\nKant, you're right that we are inextricably part of the world, but it doesn't necessarily dictate our actions. Freedom, in my view, is the ability to transcend our circumstances and give our lives meaning.\nImmanuel Kant\nI appreciate your emphasis on transcendence, Sartre, but isn't there a risk of falling into subjectivism? My concept of moral law is based on reason and universality, not personal interpretation.\nJean-Paul Sartre\nKant, I see your point, but I believe our personal interpretations are unavoidable. They shape our understanding of the world and our place in it. Freedom, then, is the ability to take responsibility for these interpretations.\nImmanuel Kant\nSartre, while personal interpretation is indeed part of human experience, it doesn't negate the existence of universal moral laws. We can't escape our responsibility toward them.\nJean-Paul Sartre\nKant, I agree that we can't escape responsibility, but it's not necessarily to a universal moral law. It's to ourselves and to the meanings we give our lives.\nImmanuel Kant\nThat's where we diverge, Sartre. I believe our actions are not merely expressions of personal meaning, but responses to moral duties. This is where free will truly manifests.\nJean-Paul Sartre\nKant, our perspectives are indeed contrasting. But perhaps they highlight the complexity of human freedom. It's not merely a question of choosing, but also of taking responsibility for one's choice.\nFurther Reading & Resources:\nImmanuel Kant's Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals\nJean-Paul Sartre's Existentialism is a Humanism\nSunday, November 9, 2025\nI saw a reel by deephood today which quoted : \"If the life given to you is based on your past karmas. That is, if you did something wrong in your past karas then you will be punished now in this life. And similarly, if you did something good in your past then you will be rewarded in this life. If this is the system then how do you accumulate? Go to Karass? I mean, like, what do you do? What is the process? Because if you do a good karma here that means you are doing that means you are just fulfilling and settling the Scots of your past kars. So if you are giving food to someone, then that means in your past someone gave that food to you. You are just are tellingling this course. So how do you accumulate good karmas to have a good life in your next life? Does that make sense to you? Because I've been thinking about this and I genuinely cannot find an answer. So what do you think? Let me know what do you think?\" - So I can definitely be wrong here, but here's what I accumulated from reading bhagwat gita, so actions have reactions and the nature, time and intensity of that reaction is nowhere mentioned nor there is a guideline as to what are deeds that can lead to better life because the whole purpose of that book was to renunciate actions - good or bad. Because actions have reactions and if you stop performing actions, there will be no reactions eventually and all the reactions of your past life will carry on to you until you no longer have any reactions left to endure and you have stopped performing actions in this life and hence you reach the state of moksh. Now first thing, actions are performed by body and reactions are endured by body. So the soul inside your body is unaffected and this realisation of your body being separate from you can let you endure and enjoy the life you are given. And lastly one cannot stop performing actions but one can remove the desire or fear from fulfillment of those actions. Hence karma and it's outcomes becomes irrelevant to those who want to stop performing actions at all.\nPhilosophical Analysis: Immanuel Kant & Friedrich Nietzsche\nIndividual Philosophical Critiques\nImmanuel Kant\nFrom Kant's perspective, the idea of karma as a system of reward and punishment might seem problematic. Kant believed in moral autonomy and the categorical imperative, suggesting we should act according to maxims that can be universalized without contradiction. If we only act well to accumulate 'good karma' for a better future life, then our actions are not truly virtuous, but motivated by personal gain. Additionally, the separation of body and soul aligns with his idea of the noumenal (true self) and phenomenal (empirical self) realms.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nNietzsche might be intrigued by the concept of 'renouncing actions' to attain 'moksh' or freedom from the cycle of birth and death. However, he might argue that this perspective promotes a negation of life and its struggles, which he might view as a form of nihilism. Nietzsche's philosophy emphasizes the affirmation of life, 'amor fati', the love of one's fate, and the will to power. The idea of enduring life's reactions without desiring outcomes could be seen as a form of his 'eternal recurrence' theory.\nPhilosophical Dialogue\nThe philosophers discuss and build upon each other's perspectives\n\nImmanuel Kant\nI appreciate your perspective, Nietzsche, but I see a contradiction. If we affirm life and its struggles, should we not act out of duty, rather than desire for good karma or fear of bad karma?\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nIndeed, Kant, but isn't your notion of duty another form of expectation, a 'should', that binds us like karma does? Perhaps the idea here is to act without any 'shoulds', simply for the sake of action itself.\nImmanuel Kant\nInteresting point. But from my perspective, duty for its own sake, without expectation, aligns with the idea of renouncing the fruits of action. It is a nuanced difference.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nPerhaps, Kant. But remember, my philosophy emphasizes not just action, but the assertion of will. Even if we renounce outcomes, isn't there still a 'will' driving our actions?\nImmanuel Kant\nTrue, Nietzsche, but this 'will' could be guided by duty, not desire. This way, we maintain moral autonomy without being driven by fear or desire.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nInteresting. Yet, I wonder, can we truly separate desire from duty or are they intertwined, shaping our will? Perhaps this is the complexity of karma.\nImmanuel Kant\nThat's a profound thought, Nietzsche. Perhaps the key lies in recognizing this complexity and acting according to principles that reflect our true selves, irrespective of future reward or punishment.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nIndeed, Kant. Perhaps, in embracing this complexity and affirming life as it comes, we find our own way to transcend karma, whatever that may look like.\nFurther Reading & Resources:\nKant's Moral Philosophy\nNietzsche's Life and Works\nSaturday, November 8, 2025\nBare Minimum - I have heard this phrase way too often in the context of a partner expecting from another a default list of things which were and are generalised by society, cinema, literature and other elements of influence and it intrigues me how quickly people adhere to these set definitions of a minimum level of efforts or actions an individual must take to characterize one self as a valid partner. So much so that not pertaining to the other person's set of demands is considered as an unfulfillment of duty. Maslow's hierarchy of needs pursued even in a parallel manner and not synchronously pertains to the fact as to what constitutes the basic needs of a human or not following some theory as well, from general perception, we can understand that a person from a decent tax bracket can very easily fulfill the basic needs of survival. Now if someone is providing any sort of effort above that minimum requirement of survival, is acting as a medium of happiness achieved from 2 layers beyond the survival needs. These acts of love and belonging should not be referenced to other partner's behaviour and should never be compared as well. They should be looked upon objectively as either helpful or if they violate the other partner in some way, they should be treated with reference to that. This comparison seems insensible as, let's suppose we are comparing two people A and B with same parameters, and person A was one's partner (let's say partner X) but performed poorly than B, so now the partner decides to move on from A and be together with B, but surprisingly B performs the same analysis and finds out Y is better than X. Hence this framework can be helpful before selection of partners, but once one is committed, actions should be performed to sustain that relationship rather than making it volatile. Naturally comparison triggers the other partner, so even when a change is required, the following should be evaluated :\n1. Whether that change is for me, do I want it or is it influenced by other people's relationships  ?\n2. Can I live without that change ? (if no and the partner can't change I would leave the relationship), (If yes, one should adjust without making it sound like an obligation because of self interest in staying together).\nAnd the way of conveying this should not be comparative but should ignite from personal problems or inconveniences. According to me, efforts should be made to self-fulfill the majority of needs an individual can possibly have, so that the person is better situated in the relationship as one stays because one wants to and not one needs to and whatever delta x happiness one receives is well appreciated and cherished.\nPhilosophical Analysis: Immanuel Kant & Friedrich Nietzsche\nIndividual Philosophical Critiques\nImmanuel Kant\nKant, who emphasized the importance of duty and moral law, would likely argue that the journal entry's perspective is somewhat problematic. He might suggest that the writer's dismissal of 'bare minimum' expectations and duties undermines the social contract that binds relationships. To Kant, the act of fulfilling duties represents an adherence to moral law, which in itself is valuable. By suggesting that partners should act from self-interest and personal satisfaction rather than duty, he might argue that the writer is advocating for subjective, potentially selfish behavior.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nNietzsche, on the other hand, may appreciate the writer's emphasis on individuality, personal fulfillment, and rejection of societal norms. In fact, his concept of 'will to power'—the drive for individual growth and self-actualization—aligns well with the writer's belief that partners should work on self-fulfillment. Nietzsche might argue that the comparison of partners and the imposition of societal 'bare minimum' standards stifles individuality and authenticity, creating resentment and dissatisfaction in relationships.\nPhilosophical Dialogue\nThe philosophers discuss and build upon each other's perspectives\n\nImmanuel Kant\nI see your point, Nietzsche. However, I worry that a purely self-interested approach to relationships could lead to chaos. Duties and obligations provide a structure that allows for mutual respect and understanding.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nBut Kant, isn't there a risk that such duties become mere social constructs, not reflective of a person's true desires or potential? The imposition of societal standards can limit individual growth.\nImmanuel Kant\nIndeed, duties should not stifle personal growth. However, they provide a moral framework that ensures respect and consideration for others. Acting purely on self-interest can lead to disregard for others' rights or feelings.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nI propose that personal growth and respect for others are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to strive for self-fulfillment while also acknowledging and respecting the individuality and rights of others.\nImmanuel Kant\nThat would indeed be an ideal situation. However, separating oneself from societal norms and expectations requires a strong moral compass and a deep understanding of one's own needs and desires, which not everyone may possess.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nI agree that it is a challenging path, but I believe it is a worthy one. Individual growth and the pursuit of authentic relationships, free from societal constructs, can lead to greater fulfillment.\nImmanuel Kant\nPerhaps a balance can be achieved, where duties and personal growth coexist. The fulfillment of duties, when understood and accepted willingly, can contribute to personal growth and satisfaction.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nThat's an interesting perspective, Kant. If duties are seen not as societal impositions but as part of one's personal growth journey, they could indeed play a role in individual fulfillment.\nFurther Reading & Resources:\nKant's Moral Philosophy\nFriedrich Nietzsche (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\nTuesday, November 4, 2025\nDeeds of selflessness for me, are very selfish - This is my confession, I am a very selfish person. Does that make me a bad person? Or why have I let myself labelled such is because I feel there is no reason not to be completely selfish. Now before being judged by the negativity surrounding the word, I would like to clarify, being selfish doesn't mean pursuing whatsoever means to achieve whatsoever of my interest. I am bound by my moral framework and would not operate outside of it. Neither does it mean I would not do things that help others, I would do them because I want to, because that supporting role in their life, makes me feel good about mine. Either the selfish happiness i derive from doing things that help others or my duty that comes when I term myself as someone in other people's lives would drive me to do things for others. But I would NEVER do something for someone if it doesn't fit in the above two scenarios and neither would I ever claim the other person responsible to do the same with me because I did. So yeah, that's something I wanted to briefly let out of my minds into these words.\nPhilosophical Analysis: Friedrich Nietzsche & Immanuel Kant\nIndividual Philosophical Critiques\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nFrom Nietzsche's perspective, the writer's self-acknowledged selfishness is a natural manifestation of the 'will to power'. He would likely appreciate the writer's honesty, as Nietzsche believed that all actions are inherently self-interested. The writer's moral framework would be seen as their personal interpretation of good and evil, shaped by their will to power. Nietzsche might encourage the writer to further question the origins and motives of their moral beliefs.\nImmanuel Kant\nKant would likely be concerned with the writer's emphasis on self-interest as the primary motivator for their actions, as he advocated for duty and universal moral law as the basis for morality — the 'categorical imperative'. Kant might argue that the writer's actions should be guided by principles that could be universally applied, independent of personal gain or satisfaction. He would likely challenge the writer to consider whether their actions hold up to this standard.\nPhilosophical Dialogue\nThe philosophers discuss and build upon each other's perspectives\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nYour self-interest is honest and natural. However, your moral framework may be a construct of societal values rather than your individual will to power. Can you confidently say your morals are truly your own?\nImmanuel Kant\nNietzsche, your emphasis on self-interest ignores the importance of duty and universal moral law. The writer must consider whether their actions could become a universal law, beyond personal satisfaction.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nKant, your 'universal moral law' imposes a homogeneity that suppresses individuality. It does not allow for the dynamic and complex nature of human will, which the writer is trying to navigate.\nImmanuel Kant\nNietzsche, while there may be complexity in human will, we cannot dismiss the necessity of universally applicable principles. Without such principles, morality becomes subjective and inconsistent.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nAnd why should morality not be subjective and individual? Isn't it more genuine to act upon one's personal convictions rather than an imposed universal law?\nImmanuel Kant\nThe danger lies in the potential for self-interest to conflict with the well-being of others. If everyone acted solely on personal convictions, the result could be chaos.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nYet, the writer is not advocating for anarchy, but for a sincere, self-aware approach to morality. This admits self-interest but within a personal moral framework.\nImmanuel Kant\nWhile self-awareness is admirable, it does not absolve one of the responsibility to act in accordance with principles that respect the rights and well-being of all individuals, not just oneself.\nFurther Reading & Resources:\nNietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy\nKant's Moral Philosophy\nSunday, November 2, 2025\nThe purpose of writing this, is to keep a track record of what i think, to what extent that thought holds objectivity for me and how it changed if it did. We are burdened or blessed by this insatiable thirst of finding purpose when we have all other factors of survival fulfilled or before that as well. We come across this question and sometimes we avoid it, sometimes we tell ourselves lies out of fear that may be all of this doesn't hold any inherent meaning or purpose and maybe we are all here by random chances, the fruit of infinite time, all of that can happen will happen in an infinite span of time (apple in a box theory). In this short span of 20 years of my life, i haven't came across any supernatural incident, and the things that have happened with some pattern which can show interest of luck, fate, god or anything metaphysical, can equivalently be explained through chances, randomness or probability. I believe that rest of the life, if i stay alive, would be no different. So on one side, i have a chance to believe in nothing, to exist just to enjoy what i have been given and what all i can get though means available to, to live to fulfill carnal desires, to let lust drive me, to live as if life is a series of available choices i can make and to navigate them such that i can have the maximum sense exploitation and to have no guilt in exploiting them as long as I don't harm others (tit-for-tat algorithm had maximum score in game-theory and harming people first is empirically less fruitful for survival). So this is one way i see living, the second way is finding the best theory, which explains a majority of principles of world, which says do this and attain eternal happiness, something beyond the physical nature of this world, there is an order beyond my understanding, there is justice and there will be reactions in proportion to my actions, even though beyond my understanding, and i can somehow escape this existence which is mostly suffering and attain something which will make me eternally happy. I can believe this as well and start following some spiritual journey as I can't know these things, the books say you need to experience them. So two paths lay down in front of me, one is the more travelled (robert frost hehehe), one more stupid yet what if it is true, i would like to exist and suffer for some idea of eternal happiness as living fr carnal self is not void of suffering as well, at times it is more painful to attain short lived pleasures for which people suffer for so long. Hence I would like to believe in order in universe and hence if there is order, there must be some governing authority and I would like to call him God.\nPhilosophical Analysis: Friedrich Nietzsche & Gautama Buddha\nIndividual Philosophical Critiques\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nFrom Nietzsche's perspective, the writer is grappling with the 'death of God', the idea that traditional morality is no longer convincing or relevant in the modern world. Nietzsche would probably agree with the writer's initial idea of embracing life's pleasures and instincts ('live as if life is a series of available choices...') as an expression of the 'will to power', his theory of the fundamental drive in all beings. However, Nietzsche would reject the writer's ultimate acceptance of an orderly universe governed by a God, viewing this as a retreat into comforting illusions.\nGautama Buddha\nThe Buddha might interpret the writer's struggle as a profound encounter with the 'Dukkha', the Buddhist concept of suffering. The writer is aware of the inescapability of suffering (both in the pursuit of pleasure and in the spiritual journey) and is seeking a way out. The Buddha would likely counsel the writer to follow the 'Middle Way', a path that avoids both sensual indulgence and severe asceticism, leading to enlightenment and liberation from suffering.\nPhilosophical Dialogue\nThe philosophers discuss and build upon each other's perspectives\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nWhile I concur with the writer's dismissal of supernatural occurrences and embrace of life's pleasures, I take issue with their final acceptance of a governing deity. This seems to be a retreat into comforting illusions, an abandonment of the noble struggle with the chaos of existence.\nGautama Buddha\nYet, Nietzsche, the writer appears to be seeking a middle ground between sensual indulgence and spiritual denial. This is indicative of their inherent wisdom, a recognition of the universal truth of suffering and the existence of a path leading beyond it.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nBuddha, your Middle Way might be seen as an attempt to escape life's inherent suffering, to find a 'safe' path that avoids the raw intensity of existence. This is not so different from the writer's hope for an orderly universe.\nGautama Buddha\nNietzsche, the Middle Way is not an escape, but a direct engagement with life as it is, unclouded by delusion or desire. Understanding the nature of things, we can transcend suffering and reach a state of peace.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nBuddha, by seeking to transcend suffering, are we not denying a fundamental aspect of existence? This struggle, this tension, is what drives us forward; it is the essence of the 'will to power'.\nGautama Buddha\nNietzsche, suffering is indeed a part of life, but it is not the entirety of it. Transcending suffering does not mean denying it, but understanding it, and through understanding, letting it go. This is the essence of liberation.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nFor the writer, I would suggest embracing the uncertainty of existence and striving to assert their individual will, rather than seeking solace in an external deity.\nGautama Buddha\nAnd I would suggest the writer to continue their introspection and inquiry, and to seek the Middle Way, a path leading beyond the dualities of pleasure and pain, and leading to true liberation.\nFurther Reading & Resources:\nThus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche\nDhammapada by Gautama Buddha\nStanford Encyclopedia entry on Friedrich Nietzsche\nStanford Encyclopedia entry on Buddhism\nNietzsche and Buddhism: A Study in Nihilism and Ironic Affinities","updatedAt":"2026-02-18T14:14:12.026Z"}
